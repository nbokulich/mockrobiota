[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota)

A public resource for microbiome bioinformatics benchmarking using artifically constructed (i.e., mock) communities.

[Searchable Inventory](./inventory.tsv) of mock communities.

mockrobiota distributes metadata and other materials associated with mock community datasets for public use, as well as links to raw sequencing data that are hosted externally. As raw data are hosted externally, mockrobiota cannot ensure the integrity or quality of raw data. Critical errors associated with any mockrobiota materials or raw data should be [reported here](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/issues). For minor issues, e.g., formatting quirks associated with raw data, or notes on the usage of a particular dataset, document this information in the ``README.md`` file, which  is located in the [home directory of each dataset](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data).

## Contributing
